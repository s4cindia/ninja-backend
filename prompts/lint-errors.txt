Error: src/services/pdf/pdf-comprehensive-parser.service.test.ts(220,29): error TS2352: Conversion of type '{ filePath: string; fileSize: number; structure: { pageCount: number; pages: never[]; metadata: { isTagged: false; }; }; pdfLibDoc: PDFDocument; pdfjsDoc: PDFDocumentProxy; }' to type 'ParsedPDF' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  The types of 'structure.metadata' are incompatible between these types.
    Type '{ isTagged: false; }' is missing the following properties from type 'PDFMetadata': pdfVersion, isEncrypted, isLinearized, hasOutline, and 2 more.
