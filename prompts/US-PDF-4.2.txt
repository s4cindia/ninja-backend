Implement US-PDF-4.2: PDF Job Queue Worker

Create a background worker that processes PDF audit jobs from the queue.

File to create: src/workers/pdf-audit.worker.ts

Requirements:

1. Job queue integration:
   - Use BullMQ (already in project) or existing queue system
   - Listen to 'accessibility-validation' queue
   - Process jobs concurrently (max 3 concurrent)

2. Job processing flow:
   a. Receive job with { jobId, filePath, userId }
   b. Update job status to 'processing'
   c. Run PdfAuditService.runAudit(filePath)
   d. Save results to database
   e. Update job status to 'completed'
   f. Handle errors and update status to 'failed'

3. Progress reporting:
   - Update job progress percentage
   - Stages: parsing (0-20%), validating (20-80%), generating-report (80-100%)
   - Emit progress events for real-time updates

4. Error handling:
   - Retry failed jobs (max 3 attempts)
   - Exponential backoff between retries
   - Log errors with full context
   - Save error message to job record

5. Cleanup:
   - Delete temporary files after processing
   - Archive old completed jobs (configurable retention)

6. Database updates:
   - Use Prisma for job status updates
   - Store audit results in appropriate tables
   - Link results to user account

7. Health monitoring:
   - Log job start/complete/fail
   - Track processing time
   - Expose metrics for monitoring

8. Graceful shutdown:
   - Complete current job before shutdown
   - Don't accept new jobs during shutdown

Reference:
- Existing EPUB worker for patterns
- PdfAuditService for audit execution
- BullMQ documentation
- Prisma schema for job records

Tests: Create pdf-audit.worker.test.ts with mocked queue
