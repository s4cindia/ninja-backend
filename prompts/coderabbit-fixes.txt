In `@src/services/pdf/pdf-audit.service.ts`:
- Around line 150-213: The PdfContrastValidatorStub currently returns no issues
and is being instantiated in the PdfAuditService constructor; replace the stub
by importing and instantiating the real PdfContrastValidator (the class named
PdfContrastValidator) instead of PdfContrastValidatorStub so contrast checks are
executed; update the validator array in PdfAuditService (constructor where new
PdfContrastValidatorStub() is used) to use new PdfContrastValidator() and remove
or retire PdfContrastValidatorStub to avoid duplicate/conflicting
implementations.

In `@src/services/pdf/pdf-comprehensive-parser.service.ts`:
- Around line 144-199: The parse and parseBuffer methods currently call
pdfParserService.close only on the success path, so if
extractComprehensiveContent or downstream code throws the PDF handle may leak;
update both parse and parseBuffer to assign the parsedPdf to a local variable
before extraction and move the pdfParserService.close(parsedPdf) call into a
finally block that always runs, wrapping the close call in its own try/catch to
log (but not rethrow) any cleanup errors; reference the parse, parseBuffer,
extractComprehensiveContent methods and the pdfParserService.close call when
making this change.

In `@src/services/pdf/validators/pdf-contrast.validator.ts`:
- Around line 89-93: The validator currently uses hardcoded colors
(textColor/backgroundColor) in pdf-contrast.validator.ts which makes contrast
checks always pass; update the contrast validation flow in the function/method
that sets textColor/backgroundColor (e.g., the contrast check or
validateContrast routine) to 1) attempt real color extraction and, if extraction
is unavailable, 2) emit a clear warning log (processLogger.warn or logger.warn)
or throw a ValidationError to fail-fast, and 3) add a TODO comment with a
tracking issue reference (or link) describing the need to implement actual color
extraction from PDF content streams so future reviewers know this is intentional
and tracked.
- Around line 162-170: The current branching makes the `ratio < 3.0 &&
isLargeText` branch unreachable; update the severity logic around the variables
severity, ratio and isLargeText so large-text thresholds are compared against
the correct upper bound. Replace the third condition with `ratio < 4.5 &&
isLargeText` (or refactor to separate large-text and normal-text branches: if
(ratio < 3.0) severity='critical'; else if (ratio < 4.5 && isLargeText)
severity='moderate'; else if (ratio < 4.5 && !isLargeText) severity='serious';
else severity='minor') to ensure the large-text path is reachable.
