In `@src/services/pdf/pdf-audit.service.ts`:
- Line 453: Duplicate exports are causing the build failure: remove the trailing
"export type { PdfValidationResult, MatterhornCheckResult };" statement so the
already-exported interfaces PdfValidationResult and MatterhornCheckResult (the
export interface declarations) remain the single source of export for those
symbols; locate the duplicate export near the end of the file and delete it to
resolve the conflict.

In `@src/services/pdf/pdf-comprehensive-parser.service.test.ts`:
- Around line 22-50: The test is using unsafe unknown casts for fs.stat and PDF
documents; update the mocks to use the correct types: import the Stats type from
'fs' and change vi.mocked(fs.stat).mockResolvedValue({ size: 1024 * 1024 } as
unknown) to a properly typed value (e.g., ({ size: 1024 * 1024 } as unknown as
fs.Stats) or construct a Partial<fs.Stats> and cast to fs.Stats) and import
PDFDocument from 'pdf-lib' and PDFDocumentProxy from 'pdfjs-dist' (or their
types) and replace pdfLibDoc: {} as unknown and pdfjsDoc: {} as unknown with
pdfLibDoc: {} as unknown as PDFDocument and pdfjsDoc: {} as unknown as
PDFDocumentProxy (and apply the same typed casting pattern to the other
occurrences listed: lines noted in the comment).
