In `@docs/acr-confidence-categories-explained.md`:
- Around line 43-54: Several fenced code blocks containing the ASCII diagram and
calculation blocks (for example the block starting with
"┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐") are missing language
identifiers; add the language tag "text" to each opening triple-backtick (e.g.,
change ``` to ```text) for every diagram/calculation fenced block in the
document so MD040 is satisfied and the blocks are treated as plain text.

In `@docs/ai-analysis-to-human-verification-integration.md`:
- Around line 128-156: The fenced ASCII diagram blocks in the document trigger
MD040 because they lack a language identifier; update each diagram fence (the
triple-backtick blocks that contain the box characters like
"┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐" through
"└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘") to include a language
tag by changing ``` to ```text so the diagrams are explicitly labeled as text;
apply this to the shown block and the other diagram blocks called out in the
comment (the remaining blocks in the same file) to satisfy the linter.

In `@docs/epub-remediation-bug/BACKEND-PHASE2-COMPLETE.md`:
- Around line 43-49: Several fenced code blocks containing plain log output
(e.g., the block beginning with "[Landmark Validation] Found 81 content files to
validate" and other similar log blocks that include lines like "[Landmark
Validation] Main landmark found in Chapter01.xhtml" and "[Landmark Validation]
Added role=\"banner\" to 00_cover.xhtml") and command blocks should include
explicit language identifiers to satisfy markdownlint; update those
triple-backtick fences to use ```text for plain output blocks and ```bash for
command/terminal blocks (apply the same change to the other affected blocks
containing similar log lines and command samples referenced in the review).
- Around line 214-217: Update the compound adjective in the bullet that
currently reads "Zero breaking changes - backward compatible" by replacing
"backward compatible" with "backward-compatible" so the line reads "Zero
breaking changes - backward-compatible"; locate the bullet in the
BACKEND-PHASE2-COMPLETE.md content where that exact phrase appears and make the
hyphenation change.

In `@docs/epub-remediation-bug/CODE-REVIEW.md`:
- Around line 124-174: Two unlabeled fenced code blocks in the CODE-REVIEW.md
doc are triggering MD040; find the two occurrences of triple-backtick blocks
that lack a language tag (the ones inside the "Suggested fix" snippet showing
the plus/minus example and the unlabeled example blocks near Issue 3.x) and
change their opening fence from ``` to ```text so they include the "text"
language identifier; this keeps markdownlint happy while preserving the existing
block contents.

In `@docs/epub-remediation-bug/epub-remediation-bug-analysis.md`:
- Around line 154-172: Update the fenced flow blocks to include the language
identifier "text": replace the opening triple backticks ("```") for the short
flow block starting with "1. Audit EPUB → Find issues" and for the "Correct
Flow" block (the multi-line flow starting "1. Audit EPUB → Find issues (scan ALL
files)") with "```text" so both flow diagrams are marked as plain text; ensure
you update the matching closing backticks remain unchanged and apply the same
change to the similar block referenced around lines 162-171.

In `@docs/epub-remediation-bug/FINAL-SUMMARY.md`:
- Around line 70-81: The fenced code blocks in the FINAL-SUMMARY are missing
language identifiers; update each block that shows file diffs or log/output to
include an appropriate language label (e.g., use "text" for plain listings,
"bash" for shell output, or "json" where relevant). Specifically, add language
identifiers to the blocks that mention src/services/epub/epub-audit.service.ts
(including calculateCoverage() and categorizeFiles() and the updated
EpubAuditResult interface), src/services/epub/remediation.service.ts (landmark
validation integration), and src/services/epub/epub-modifier.service.ts
(validateAndFixLandmarks()), and apply the same change to the other referenced
ranges (84-93, 96-109, 127-139, 216-231) so all fenced blocks consistently
include the correct language tag.

In `@docs/epub-remediation-bug/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`:
- Around line 246-249: The fenced code block in IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md is
missing a language specifier (MD040); update the triple-backtick fence that
wraps "Read docs/epub-remediation-bug/FRONTEND-IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md Then
implement all frontend tasks (`#3`, `#4`, `#5`, `#6`)" to include a language token such
as "text" (e.g., ```text) so the block becomes a proper fenced code block with a
language specifier.

In `@docs/epub-remediation-bug/README.md`:
- Around line 71-91: The markdown has unlabeled fenced code blocks (the "Phase
1/2/3/4" diagrams and other blocks noted) causing MD040 warnings; update each
fenced block by adding an appropriate language identifier (e.g., use text for
diagrams, bash for command examples) so the opening fences become
triple-backticks with the language (e.g., ```text) for the blocks around the
Phase sections and the other ranges mentioned (blocks at the shown snippets and
at the other locations referenced).

In `@src/controllers/epub.controller.ts`:
- Around line 700-718: The response payload from the re-audit endpoint omits the
error fields required by the controller contract; update the res.json call that
returns { success, message, data, rawResult } to include an error object and
errorCode when result contains error information (use result.error and
result.errorCode or derive from result.status/code), ensuring the top-level
shape follows success:boolean, data?:object, error?:object,
errorCode?:string|number; modify the branch that builds the response (where
result, isFullyCompliant, message are computed) to attach error: result.error ||
null and errorCode: result.errorCode || undefined (or map existing result
fields) so backward-compatible consumers receive the error and errorCode fields.

In `@src/services/epub/epub-audit.service.ts`:
- Around line 689-717: In calculateCoverage, stop returning a hardcoded 100 and
compute percentage dynamically using totalFiles and filesScanned (both derived
from contentFiles.length / filesScanned) with a zero-file guard to avoid
division by zero — e.g., if totalFiles === 0 set percentage to 0 otherwise
percentage = Math.round((filesScanned / totalFiles) * 100); update the returned
object (in calculateCoverage) to use this computed percentage and keep
fileCategories from categorizeFiles(contentFiles).

In `@src/services/epub/epub-modifier.service.ts`:
- Around line 2218-2387: The function validateAndFixLandmarks currently returns
an object shape that doesn't match the declared Promise<ModificationResult> and
pushes change objects with a modificationType property not present on
FileChange; define a new interface LandmarkValidationResult (e.g., { buffer:
Buffer; changes: LandmarkFileChange[]; success: boolean; error?: string }) and a
LandmarkFileChange type that includes modificationType, filePath, description,
oldContent?, content?; update the validateAndFixLandmarks signature to return
Promise<LandmarkValidationResult>, change the local changes array to be
LandmarkFileChange[], and ensure all returned/assigned objects match these new
types (replace references to ModificationResult/FileChange in this module for
this function).
