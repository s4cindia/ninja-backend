Implement US-PDF-2.1: PDF Structure Validator

Create a validator that checks PDF document structure for accessibility compliance.

File to create: src/services/pdf/validators/pdf-structure.validator.ts

Requirements:

1. Extend or implement interface compatible with BaseAuditService pattern

2. Validate document structure:
   - Check if PDF is tagged (critical issue if not)
   - Validate heading hierarchy (H1 before H2, no skipped levels)
   - Check reading order is logical
   - Verify document language is set
   - Check title is present in metadata

3. Validate content structure:
   - Lists are properly marked up (L, LI, Lbl, LBody)
   - Tables have proper structure (Table, TR, TH, TD)
   - Figures are marked as Figure elements
   - Block quotes are marked appropriately

4. Map issues to WCAG criteria:
   - 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
   - 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (Level A)
   - 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Level A)
   - 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)
   - 3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A)

5. Map issues to Matterhorn checkpoints:
   - 01-003: Document not tagged
   - 01-004: Suspect tag structure
   - 06-001: Heading structure
   - 09-004: Reading order
   - 11-001: Document language

6. Return array of AuditIssue objects with:
   - severity (critical/serious/moderate/minor)
   - message, description
   - wcagCriteria, matterhornCheckpoint
   - location (page number, element path)
   - suggestedFix

Reference: Use BaseAuditService types from src/services/audit/base-audit.service.ts

Tests: Create pdf-structure.validator.test.ts with tests for tagged and untagged PDFs.
