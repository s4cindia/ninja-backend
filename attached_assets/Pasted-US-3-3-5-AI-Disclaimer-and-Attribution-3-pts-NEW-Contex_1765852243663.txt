US-3.3.5: AI Disclaimer and Attribution (3 pts) — NEW
Context

Prerequisites
US-3.3.4 (Nuanced Compliance Status) complete
Objective
Add clear attribution distinguishing AI-detected findings from human-verified findings to reduce legal liability.

Technical Requirements
Create AI attribution and disclaimer service.
**Create file: `src/services/acr/attribution.service.ts`**
type AttributionTag = 
  | 'AUTOMATED'       // Fully automated check
  | 'AI_SUGGESTED'    // AI-generated content (alt text, remediation suggestions)
  | 'HUMAN_VERIFIED'; // Human has confirmed this finding
interface AttributedFinding {
  findingId: string;
  attributionTag: AttributionTag;
  automatedToolVersion: string;
  aiModelUsed?: string;      // e.g., "Google Gemini 1.5 Pro"
  humanVerifier?: string;
  verificationMethod?: string;
}
interface MethodologySection {

accessibility professionals before use in procurement decisions.
Assessment Tool: Ninja Platform v1.0
AI Model: Google Gemini (for alt text suggestions and remediation guidance)
