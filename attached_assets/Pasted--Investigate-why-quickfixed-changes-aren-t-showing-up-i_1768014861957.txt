 Investigate why quickfixed changes aren't showing up in the comparison view.

  First, let's check if quickfixes are being logged to the RemediationChange table.

  Add a temporary diagnostic endpoint in src/routes/comparison.routes.ts:

  ```typescript
  // Diagnostic endpoint to check all changes for a job
  router.get(
    '/jobs/:jobId/comparison/all-changes',
    authenticateToken,
    asyncHandler(async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
      const { jobId } = req.params;

      const changes = await prisma.remediationChange.findMany({
        where: { jobId },
        select: {
          id: true,
          changeNumber: true,
          changeType: true,
          description: true,
          filePath: true,
          status: true,
          appliedAt: true,
          // Add any fields that might indicate source (autofix vs quickfix)
        },
        orderBy: { changeNumber: 'asc' }
      });

      res.json({
        totalChanges: changes.length,
        changesByType: changes.reduce((acc, c) => {
          acc[c.changeType] = (acc[c.changeType] || 0) + 1;
          return acc;
        }, {} as Record<string, number>),
        changesByStatus: changes.reduce((acc, c) => {
          acc[c.status] = (acc[c.status] || 0) + 1;
          return acc;
        }, {} as Record<string, number>),
        changes
      });
    })
  );

  Call this endpoint to see all changes for a job where you performed both autofixes and quickfixes.

  Then search your codebase for where quickfix changes are applied. Look for:
  1. Files related to quickfix functionality
  2. Where quickfix updates are made to the EPUB
  3. Whether RemediationChange records are created for quickfixes

  The issue is likely one of:
  - Quickfixes aren't logging to RemediationChange at all
  - Quickfixes are logged with a different status that's filtered out
  - Quickfixes update the EPUB but don't create comparison records

  ## Expected Issues and Fixes

  ### Issue 1: Quickfixes Not Logged
  **If quickfixes don't create RemediationChange records:**

  You need to find the quickfix implementation and add logging:
  ```typescript
  // When a quickfix is applied, log it:
  await prisma.remediationChange.create({
    data: {
      jobId,
      changeNumber: nextChangeNumber,
      filePath: affectedFile,
      changeType: 'QUICKFIX_' + issueType, // e.g., QUICKFIX_ALT_TEXT
      description: `Quick fix: ${description}`,
      beforeContent: originalContent,
      afterContent: fixedContent,
      status: 'APPLIED',
      severity: 'MEDIUM',
      elementXPath: xpath
    }
  });

  Issue 2: Different Status Filtering

  If quickfixes use a different status:

  Check the comparison query - it might be filtering by status:
  // In comparison.service.ts, ensure all statuses are included:
  const changes = await prisma.remediationChange.findMany({
    where: {
      jobId,
      // Don't filter by status - include all changes
    }
  });

  Next Steps

  1. Call the diagnostic endpoint to see what changes exist in the database
  2. Search for quickfix code in your backend (grep -r "quickfix" src/ or grep -r "quick fix" src/)
  3. Share the findings - tell me:
    - How many changes show up in the diagnostic endpoint?
    - Do you see any quickfix-related changes?
    - Where is the quickfix functionality implemented?

  Then we can fix the logging to ensure quickfixes are tracked just like autofixes!
