Fix: Implement consistent accessibility scoring across all audit sources

  The current score (72) doesn't match expected calculation with 9 critical issues. Review and fix the scoring logic in epub-audit.service.ts.

  Recommended scoring approach:

  // In epub-audit.service.ts

  interface ScoreBreakdown {
    score: number;
    deductions: {
      critical: { count: number; points: number };
      serious: { count: number; points: number };
      moderate: { count: number; points: number };
      minor: { count: number; points: number };
    };
    maxScore: number;
  }

  function calculateAccessibilityScore(issues: AuditIssue[]): ScoreBreakdown {
    const weights = {
      critical: 10,  // Reduced from 15 to prevent quick zeroing
      serious: 5,
      moderate: 2,
      minor: 1,
    };

    const counts = {
      critical: issues.filter(i => i.severity === 'critical').length,
      serious: issues.filter(i => i.severity === 'serious').length,
      moderate: issues.filter(i => i.severity === 'moderate').length,
      minor: issues.filter(i => i.severity === 'minor').length,
    };

    const deductions = {
      critical: { count: counts.critical, points: counts.critical * weights.critical },
      serious: { count: counts.serious, points: counts.serious * weights.serious },
      moderate: { count: counts.moderate, points: counts.moderate * weights.moderate },
      minor: { count: counts.minor, points: counts.minor * weights.minor },
    };

    const totalDeduction =
      deductions.critical.points +
      deductions.serious.points +
      deductions.moderate.points +
      deductions.minor.points;

    return {
      score: Math.max(0, 100 - totalDeduction),
      deductions,
      maxScore: 100,
    };
  }

  Update the audit response to include score breakdown:

  // In the audit result response
  {
    score: scoreBreakdown.score,
    scoreBreakdown: {
      formula: "100 - (critical × 10) - (serious × 5) - (moderate × 2) - (minor × 1)",
      weights: { critical: 10, serious: 5, moderate: 2, minor: 1 },
      deductions: scoreBreakdown.deductions,
      totalDeduction: 100 - scoreBreakdown.score,
    },
    // ... rest of audit result
  }

  With revised weights (10/5/2/1), the screenshot example would be:
  - 9 critical × 10 = 90
  - 0 serious × 5 = 0
  - 2 moderate × 2 = 4
  - 3 minor × 1 = 3
  - Score: 100 - 97 = 3

  Alternative: Cap deductions per category to prevent single category from zeroing score:

  const cappedDeductions = {
    critical: Math.min(counts.critical * weights.critical, 50), // Max 50 from critical
    serious: Math.min(counts.serious * weights.serious, 25),
    moderate: Math.min(counts.moderate * weights.moderate, 15),
    minor: Math.min(counts.minor * weights.minor, 10),
  };
